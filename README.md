**Software Requirements Specification (SRS) Document for Zero-Code ML Model**

---

### 1. Introduction

**Purpose:**\
The Zero-Code ML Model is designed to allow users with no coding experience to build, train, and deploy machine learning models seamlessly. The system will provide an intuitive UI to upload data, configure ML settings, and obtain predictive results.

**Scope:**\
This project aims to bridge the gap between technical and non-technical users by providing an automated workflow for ML model development. It will support various data formats, automate preprocessing, and generate model insights.

**Overview:**

- Users can upload structured data.
- The system will preprocess the data and select the best model.
- Predictions will be generated and visualized via the UI.

### 2. General Description

**Functions:**

- Upload datasets in CSV, Excel, or JSON format.
- Automated feature selection and preprocessing.
- Model selection and training.
- Output predictions and visualizations.
- Export results in multiple formats.

**User Community:**

- Business analysts
- Educators and students
- Researchers
- Small business owners
